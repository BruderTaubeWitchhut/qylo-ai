**Better choices, when it matters.**

Qylo.ai is an AI-powered decision feedback platform that helps people make more sustainable choices **only at the moment a decision is made** — without tracking daily habits or collecting intrusive data.

---

## 🌱 Problem
Sustainability often breaks down at the point of decision.  
Most tools expect users to track electricity, food, or lifestyle data they don’t fully understand, making them hard to adopt and easy to ignore.

People don’t need constant monitoring — they need **clear, practical guidance when a situation arises**.

---

## 💡 Solution
Qylo.ai flips the model.

Instead of habit tracking, Qylo.ai:
- Activates only when a user logs a real-life situation
- Generates multiple realistic alternatives using AI
- Shows environmental impact **alongside personal cost**
- Lets users choose freely or add their own option

No guilt. No interference. Just clarity when it matters.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User logs a situation (e.g., travel, event planning, purchasing)
2. AI generates 3–4 alternative actions
3. Each option displays:
   - Carbon impact
   - Water usage
   - Waste generation
   - Personal cost (₹)
4. User selects an option or adds a custom one
5. AI explains the outcome and updates impact metrics

---

## 🤝 Community Intelligence
Qylo.ai learns from real human choices:
- Tracks which options users choose most often
- Identifies patterns in practical decision-making
- Improves future suggestions using community preference data

This creates a **human-aware sustainability system**, not an idealistic one.

---
